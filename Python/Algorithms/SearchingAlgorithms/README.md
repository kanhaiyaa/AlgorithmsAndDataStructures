## 1. Sequential/Linear Search
Sequentially checks each element of the list until a match is found or whole list has been searched. 

Complexity- O(n)

## 2. Interval Search

These types of algorithms specifically designed for searching in sorted data structures.

Ex- Binary Seach - Uses divide and conquer!

We divide the problem into smaller pieces and solve the smaller pieces in some way and then reasemble the whole program to get the result.
